#minishell

🚀 This project was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences in the 42 curriculum. It involved handling numerous test cases and learning a wide range of topics, 
from software architecture and system calls to team coordination and task distribution.

⚡ Initially, building a shell that mimics Bash seemed intimidating. My prior knowledge of shells was limited to basic usage, and I had no idea how they worked internally.

➥ Creating a shell from scratch was a significant challenge, but it highlighted one of the core aspects I love about the 42 pedagogy: 
constantly facing new challenges and learning opportunities, from the early days of the Piscine (42 selection phase) up to now.

💥 Minishell is a substantial project, especially for beginners, and it required careful planning and research to avoid major redesigns later—although I still ended up making significant changes.

👨🏻‍💻👩🏽‍💻 Since this was a team project, I needed to find a partner. After forming a team of two, we started coordinating tasks and working together.

🛑 The shell has two main parts: parsing (processing user input) and execution (running the parsed commands). 
Through this project, I not only improved my technical skills but also learned valuable lessons in teamwork and project management.

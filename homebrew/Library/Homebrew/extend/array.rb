class Array
  # Equal to `self[1]`.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # ```ruby
  # %w( a b c d e ).second # => "b"
  # ```
  def second = self[1]

  # Equal to `self[2]`.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # ```ruby
  # %w( a b c d e ).third # => "c"
  # ```
  def third = self[2]

  # Equal to `self[3]`.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # ```ruby
  # %w( a b c d e ).fourth # => "d"
  # ```
  def fourth = self[3]

  # Equal to `self[4]`.
  #
  # ### Example
  #
  # ```ruby
  # %w( a b c d e ).fifth # => "e"
  # ```
  def fifth = self[4]

  # Converts the array to a comma-separated sentence where the last element is
  # joined by the connector word.
  #
  # ### Examples
  #
  # ```ruby
  # [].to_sentence                      # => ""
  # ['one'].to_sentence                 # => "one"
  # ['one', 'two'].to_sentence          # => "one and two"
  # ['one', 'two', 'three'].to_sentence # => "one, two and three"
  # ['one', 'two'].to_sentence(two_words_connector: '-')
  # # => "one-two"
  # ```
  #
  # ```
  # ['one', 'two', 'three'].to_sentence(words_connector: ' or ', last_word_connector: ' or at least ')
  # # => "one or two or at least three"
  # ```

# How To Organize AGM

AGM is our combination of business meeting, yearly work planning session, and opportunity to meet others in our international team in person.

This document is a _guide_ that assumes that the meeting will be held in person.
If a situation occurs that prevents that, it is acceptable to execute it virtually, as was done in 2021 and 2022 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Logistics Timeline

Past practice and future intent is for AGM to coincide with [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org "Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting"), which is held in Brussels, Belgium annually typically on the Saturday and Sunday of the fifth ISO-8601 week of the calendar year, calculable with:

    ruby -rdate -e "s=ARGV[0].to_i;s.upto(s+4).map{|y|Date.commercial(y,5,6)}.each{|y|puts [y,y+1].join(' - ')}" 2024

AGM should be held on the Friday before or the Monday following FOSDEM.

:information_source: _Regenerate the dates for the WHEN lines in the next several headers
using this quick command:_

    ruby -rdate -e "YEAR=ARGV[0].to_i;puts ([[44,YEAR-1],[49,YEAR-1]]+(1.upto(4).map{|wk|[wk, YEAR]})).map{|wk,yr|Date.commercial(yr,wk).to_s}" 2024

      [applying for a visa](https://5195.f2w.bosa.be/en/themes/entry/border-control/visa/visa-type-c)

## Pre-planning

### Finding a meeting venue

In the past, PLC hosted the AGM at the
[THON Hotel Brussels City Centre](https://www.thonhotels.com/conference/belgium/brussels/thon-hotel-brussels-city-centre/?Persons=20)
and arranged for a room block checking in the day before FOSDEM and AGM weekend, generally on Friday, and checking out the day after, generally Tuesday when the AGM is Monday.

### Who qualifies for AGM travel assistance

Travel assistance is available for AGM participants who are expected to attend the AGM in-person.
Those who have employers able to cover all or a part of the costs of attending FOSDEM should exhaust that
source of funding before seeking Homebrew funding.

PLC, TSC, PL and maintainers can expect to have all reasonable, in-policy expenses covered while members will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Read the Expense and Reimbursement policy document in `Homebrew/homebrew-governance-private`.
It contains the process and details on what is covered.
It is important that all attendees expecting reimbursement stay in-policy.

## Ideas for future AGMs

### Meeting enhancements

* Captioning or transcription, or both - [White Coat Captioning](https://whitecoatcaptioning.com) could handle the live captioning and provide us that for a transcript.
* Separate meeting runner
  * Keep PL ideally focused on content and not agenda or tracking who's asked to speak
  * Should be a PLC member who is not the AC, LC, or TC
  * Should be someone happy and willing to cut people off mid-sentence and, assertively but in a friendly manner, stop conversations that are not running to time

### Day-of enhancements

* Track dietary requirements centrally for in-person participants
